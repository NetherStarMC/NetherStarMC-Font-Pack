# NetherStarMC-Font-Pack
For font junkies, as famous Raymond Larabie so eloquently puts it. Below can be found a Q&A section about this very font pack.

## Are any of these fonts pirated?
Nope! Each and every one (except for the ones I made) is property of their original owners, so everything's above board.

## Can I distribute this font pack?
Yes! However, you have to include this README file, or you'll be nothing but a pirate, and pirates can go hang!

## Where did you even get these fonts?
From multiple free font websites (e.g., DaFont.com and 1001 Fonts, among others), including those from the _Fonts_ folder on my computer.

More questions to come.
